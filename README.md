# Calculator
My first project that I created. A working calculator written in C#.

This was my very first "big" project that I worked on. I built this using the small knowledge that I had of the C# programing language. This was the first time I had ever built something completely by myself and finished it. I worked on this project during the Spring semester of 2017. I learned a lot about programming from this project, it helped reassure me that I wanted to further my knowledge and education in programming.

This program was the first project that I worked on and sent out to my friends to test and to download for themselves. It may not be much, but it will always hold a special place in my heart.
